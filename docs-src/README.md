# Redux Simple Api

Redux Simple Api (**RSA**) is a library that helps handling requests
with redux. It is common problem for many developers - a lot of code
required to handle asynchronous actions. You can mitigate it using
`redux-thunk` and `redux-simple-api`.

`rsa` libary can be used with any redux-compatible view library, but it was
tested only with React.

## Installation

```
npm install --save-dev redux-simple-api
